# Cognitive Model for a Mental Folding Task

![Demo of MF model in action](mf_demo.gif)

A simulated replication of the experiment and a cognitive model solving the mental folding task. The model was formalised and implemented in ACT-R, based on cognitive processes theorised by Shepard and Feng (1972). Like the mental rotation model, it followed an outline proposed by Just and Carpenter (1976) comprised of visual encoding, transformation and comparison, and motor response.
